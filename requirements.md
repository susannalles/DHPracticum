## I. Active participation 
 
## II. Exercises 
Students will have weekly digital exercises with the different technologies seen in class. They will be also asked to follow several tutorials to deepen the hands-on work and understanding of technologies and tools.  
 
## III. Formal Presentations  

- The first presentation will offer a basic introductory overview of the student’s DH knowledge (this knowledge may be limited or none, or may be more extensive). They will outline their personal research goals for the course seminar and offer preliminary ideas for both the skills they hope to require and the projects they may develop in the practicum. **Due date: Sept. 6th** 

- Each student will be asked to formally guide the seminar for one class meeting. In this they will present a clearly articulated argument about one or more of the course readings for that day, offer examples of projects, tools, and/or texts relevant to the assigned material and be responsible for guiding questions that will launch the in-class discussion. Dates will be alloted at the beginning of the semester.

- Each student will be asked to offer a formal presentation addressing their course project at the close of the practicum. This presentation should attend to several issues: a) a general overview of the project; b) a theoretical contextualization of the digital methodology used; c) a technical description of the implementation of their project; d) key issued they have faced; e) future perspective for the preservation and further development of their project.  **Due date: Dec. 6th**. 
 
## IV. Annotated bibliography 
Students will elaborate a formal bibliography that will include citations of sources with summary and evaluation information for each source. The assignment should be in MLA format. They will select five works not on the course syllabus and relevant to their digital humanities project.  For samples, see: <https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/614/03/>  **Due date: Nov. 8th**. 
 
## V. Project Consultation Conferences
Each student will meet with Digital Scholarship Librarian Dr. Paige Morgan twice for approximately 30 minutes within the semester (once at the beginning, once at the end) in order to make progress towards their final digital project. Preparation for these conferences will include a mandatory conference memo. (You can also meet with Dr. Morgan at other times with questions about project management and development, technology, data curation, or other questions — but the two project consultation conferences are required.)

## VI. Final Digital Project 
Each student, independently or in collaboration, will deliver a digital project relevant to the PhD dissertation or current research. They will have to deliver a partial or fully realized digital project. Please note that while this course does not require students to produce an article or essay, these projects must be original, clearly articulated, and the formal presentation that accompanies them must explain in clear detail the methodological approach, argument/intervention, and relevance of the project. **Due date: Dec. 6th**.
